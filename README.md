# running-wishes

Running Wishes is a unique fundraising application meant to encourage sport practicing. The purpose of the application is to raise money for charity cases, 
for example for children with special needs that come from a certain helping association. The users of this application participate to different sport competitions, 
in order to help people in need. The donations for the charity cases are made by the competitions' sponsors, based on a certain sum of money from the entry ticket fee.

Each charity case needs a certain amount of money for solving their special need. With each donation received, the raised sum will be updated and the person will be closer to fulfilling their wish. The donation will be directed to that person that has raised the smaller amount of money compared to the needed fund. Each sponsor can make as many donations as competitions sponsored. The donation fund will be calculated as half of the ticket fee per competition times the number of participants to that competition.
