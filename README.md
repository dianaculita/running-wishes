# running-wishes

Running Wishes is a unique fundraising application meant to encourage sport practicing. The purpose of the application is to raise money for charity cases, 
for example for children with special needs that come from a certain helping association. The users of this application participate to different sport competitions, 
in order to help people in need. The donations for the charity cases are made by the competitions, each competition being able to make as many donations as the fundraising budget allows. The fundraising budget is composed of a part of the total tickets paid by the users and of the sponsoring money sent by the contribuing sponsors.

Each charity case needs a certain amount of money for solving their special need. With each donation received, the raised sum will be updated and the person will be closer to fulfilling their wish. The donation will be directed to that person that has raised the smaller amount of money compared to the needed fund.

As for the competitors (users), they can enroll to as many competitions as they want, with update possible. That means that when a user is created, the competitions list can be empty at first and updated later. The only mention is that once he enroller to a competition, the ticket is non refundable if withdrawal.

As for the sponsors, withdrawal or update of the sponsoring amount of money is possible and in this case, the competitions with whom they collaborate need to update their fundraising budget.
