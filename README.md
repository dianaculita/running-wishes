# running-wishes

Running Wishes is a unique fundraising application meant to encourage sport practicing. The purpose of the application is to raise money for charity cases, 
for example for children with special needs that come from a certain helping association. The users of this application participate to different sport competitions, 
in order to help people in need. The donations for the charity cases are made by the competitions' sponsors, based on a certain sum of money from the entry ticket fee.
